# Welcome to the HelloJunior Project
# A jobs board for junior developers by junior developers

# Who?
  This job board is for entry level developers who are looking to get their foot
  in the door of their first company. This is about matching the right employers
  with the right talent for the job.

# Why?
  We started HelloJunior as a way to cater to those junior devs who are tired of
  filtering through loads of senior or mid level positions. Also, for the juniors
  who want to connect with a company that is about support and growth of their potential.
  HelloJunior is also for employers that know that CS degree doesn't necessarily equate
  to top talent. For employers, who are interested in those with CS degrees and non CS
  backgrounds.
